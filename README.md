# CS230_GamingRoom
**Overview**
This repository contains my CS 230 Software Design Document for The Gaming Room project. The purpose of this document is to demonstrate my ability to work through the software design process and effectively communicate it to both the client and the development team. This document is also a part of my portfolio submission for the Computer Science program.

**The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements**
The client, The Gaming Room, needed a software solution to support their game, Draw It or Lose It, on multiple platforms. The goal was to transition the game from a single-platform environment to a web-based distributed system, ensuring scalability, security, and multi-platform compatibility.

**Key Strengths in Developing the Documentation**
One of the strengths in my documentation was providing a structured and clear design that outlined the system architecture, constraints, and security measures. I also effectively utilized object-oriented principles such as inheritance and the Singleton design pattern to improve the softwareâ€™s maintainability and performance.

**How the Design Document Helped in Development**
Creating a design document helped establish a clear roadmap before coding, reducing ambiguity and ensuring alignment with the client's requirements. It also made debugging and future modifications easier by defining system components in advance.

**Areas for Improvement**
If I could revise one part of my work, I would enhance the user experience (UX) design considerations by adding more details on interface design, accessibility, and performance optimization.

**Understanding User Needs and Implementation**
I interpreted user needs by closely aligning my design with their business goals and technical constraints. It is crucial to prioritize user needs because a software solution should not only function well but also provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users.

**Approach to Software Design**
For this project, I used:

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) for better code reusability and modularity.
UML Diagrams to visualize relationships between different components.
Singleton Design Pattern for managing game instances efficiently.
Cloud-Based Storage and APIs for scalability and real-time interactions.
For future projects, I plan to incorporate Agile development methodologies, focusing on iterative design improvements and user feedback integration.
